# VGA Image Generation Project

## Overview
Welcome to the VGA Image Generation Project! This project uses Verilog and the DE2-115 board to create a dynamic image display system on a VGA monitor. Users can interactively modify the RGB signals of a radial gradient image using the DE2-115 boardâ€™s switches.

## Quick Start
- Clone the repository to get started with the project.
- Follow the setup instructions in the Wiki to configure your DE2-115 board and run the project.

## Documentation
For a comprehensive understanding of the project, including its design, results, and the complexities involved, please visit our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/smithcn9/ECE287-Final-Project/wiki). The Wiki provides detailed information on every aspect of the project, from background information to the technical details of the implementation.
